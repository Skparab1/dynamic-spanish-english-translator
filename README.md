# how it will work
- on a command-line interface
- if the user types a word, in spanish or english, the program will retrieve the meaning in the other language.
- if the word is not found, it will say entry not found
- if the user wants to add a new entry, the user has to type [spanishword] = [englishword] with the words being the corresponding words.
